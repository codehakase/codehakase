**Hi, I'm Francis.**

I'm a ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ software engineer with a strong foundation in backend and infra development and a passion for tackling complex challenges. I'm fascinated by distributed systems, databases, and functional programming, and I primarily work with Go and Haskell.

You can read more about me on my [personal website](https://codehakase.com/about). You can also check me out on BlueSky [@codehakase.com](https://bsky.app/profile/codehakase.com) or Twitter (X): [@codehakase](https://x.com/codehakase).

I publish articles on my [blog](https://codehakase.com/blog):
{{ range (slice .Posts 0 5) }}
- ðŸ“° [{{ .Title }}]({{ .Link }}) <sub><em>- {{ FormatTime .PublishedAt }}</em></sub>
{{- end }}

As often as I can, I publish short-form content and quick notes called [shorts](https://codehakase.com/shorts):
{{ range (slice .Shorts 0 5) }}
- ðŸ”– [{{ .Title }}]({{ .Link }}) <sub><em>- {{ FormatTime .PublishedAt }}</em></sub>
{{- end }}
